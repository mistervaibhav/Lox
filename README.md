📘 Welcome to the repository for "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom! 🚀 This repository contains code implementations from the book, as I embark on the exciting journey of learning language interpreters.

## About Me

👋 Hi, I'm Vaibhav Singh, and I'm currently diving into the world of language implementation through "Crafting Interpreters." This repository serves as my learning playground, where I explore the intricacies of building interpreters for the programming language "Lox." The book guides me through creating both a straightforward "tree-walk" interpreter and a more advanced bytecode virtual machine.

## About the Book

"Crafting Interpreters" is an excellent resource for learning the ins and outs of building interpreters. The book walks you through the process of creating two interpreters for the programming language "Lox." The first interpreter is a straightforward "tree-walk" interpreter, and the second one is a more advanced bytecode virtual machine.
